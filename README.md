# Bore-Dape 
This repository contains a simple NFT marketplace that simulates the bored ape yatch club collection. Users have the option to mint apes and it belongs to them automatically and others can buy it from them. This mock collection is a proof of concept for the NFT tokenization and transferability protocol. It could be used to start community where owners of the token have access to certain rights and privileges and access to events.
